## Cookie Policy

### Date of last revision January 27, 2020

This Cookie Policy (“**Cookie Policy**”) explains how Teller Inc. and its subsidiaries, (collectively, “**we**”, “**our**”, or “**us**”), and trusted third parties, use cookies on our websites and other online services (collectively the “**Services**”), as well as your choices related to those cookies. Please review this Cookie Policy to learn more about the types of cookies we use, why we use them, and how you can control or limit the use of cookies.

To find out more about our privacy practices, please refer to our End User Privacy Policy and our Developer Privacy Policy.

### What Are Cookies

Cookies are small data files stored on your browser or device, which can be in the form of session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) or persistent cookies (which stay on your browser for a set period of time or until you delete them). They generally contain information such as website preferences, user settings, and browsing history. This information helps us recognize you as you interact with or revisit our Services.

Cookies may be served by the entity that operates the website you are visiting (“first-party cookies”) or by other companies (“third-party cookies”). For example, we use first-party cookies to remember your settings and preferences, such as language and location. We also integrate third-party analytics cookies, like Google Analytics, onto our websites to help us understand how you are using our websites so that we can improve them.

We also use other technologies that function similarly to cookies. For instance, we use web beacons (also called pixels), which are small images on a web page or in an email. Web beacons collect information about your browser or device and can set cookies. In addition, we use local storage, which allows data to be stored locally on your browser or device.

### How We Use Cookies

We use cookies for a number of reasons, like helping us determine the popularity of certain content, improving our Services and your experience, and to better understand your online activity. The cookies we use generally fall into one or more of the following categories:

| CATEGORY OF COOKIES | HOW WE USE THESE COOKIES |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Essential | These cookies are strictly necessary for our Services to function properly. Some of our Services depend on these cookies and may not work properly, or at all, if they are disabled. |
| Security | We use these cookies to help identify and mitigate potential security risks. |
| Preferences | We use these cookies to remember your settings and preferences, such as language and location, when you use our Services. |
| Analytics | We use these cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services so that we can improve them. For example, we may use these cookies to determine if you have interacted with certain content or features. We can also use these cookies to learn more about which features are the most popular with our users and where we may need to make improvements. | 

### Your Choices

You have the right to choose whether or not to accept cookies. However, since cookies can be an important part of how our Services work, if you remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Services.

Below are some options to control or limit how cookies are used on our Services:

* You can usually manage settings to remove or reject browser cookies manually within your browser’s configuration settings. To manage these settings, please follow the instructions given by your browser.
* To prevent your data from being used by Google Analytics, you can install Google’s opt-out browser add-on.
* For information on how our advertising partners may allow you to opt out of receiving ads based on your web browsing history, please visit [http://optout.aboutads.info/](http://optout.aboutads.info/). 

### Changes to This Policy

We may update or change the cookies (or similar technologies) we use from time to time. The most up-to-date version of this Policy will be posted on our website, and if we make any changes, we will update the updated date at the top of the Cookies Policy. We recommend that you check back periodically for any changes.
